const PREF = {
    survival: 2,
    kill: 1,
    wincon: 4,
}

A. Pre-processing
For a given AI unit, assign a value to each tile, based on how much it wants to be on this tile
Can be negative

1: assign to each enemy units:
    - threat level (melee and range)
    - bounty value
   and to each allied unit
    - protection level that ally provides
    - help level that ally needs
2: assign to tiles (apply unit's PREF coeficients):
    - total threat of nearby units -> negative value
    - total bounty of nearby units -> positive value
    - total protection provided by nearby units -> positive value
    - total help needed by nearby units -> positive value

B. Check attack options
    simulate attack on each potential target, get value (damage * bounty * PREF ?)

C. Compare attack options (attack value + current tile value after attack) to move options (tile value + opportunity attack faced), pick best
    (challenge: evaluate the tile value after player moves, will that juicy target still be there ? bounty value lower if unit can still move ?)
    for move options, take opportunity attack into account
